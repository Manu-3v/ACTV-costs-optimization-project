**Project Description**

This project revolves around the creation of a linear programming problem, segmented into three scenarios, and its resolution through the identification and formulation of a 
dedicated linear mathematical model. The primary objective is to develop a cost-minimization model tailored for a transportation company, specifically targeting the Azienda del
Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano(ACTV), leveraging available commuter routes.

The problem statement is subsequently translated into executable code. Through the integration of Pyomo, a Python optimization modeling language, and the "Gurobi" solver, we 
achieve the capability to derive optimal solutions for this transportation optimization challenge.

This project was developed: 
 - for the exam of **Managerual Decision Making and Modelling [EM1407]**
 - of the degree program **Data Analytics for Business and Society**
 - at **Universit√† Ca' Foscari di Venezia**
 - by **Daniele Barbato**, **Eleonora Marcassa**, **Manuel Trevisan**
